# Healthcare Data Analysis with Amazon Athena and AWS Glue

This project demonstrates the process of analyzing healthcare data using Amazon Athena and AWS Glue. The dataset contains information about patients, including their demographic details, medical conditions, hospital admissions, billing information, and medical tests. By leveraging AWS Glue to crawl the dataset and create a table in the Glue Data Catalog, and using Amazon Athena for SQL-based analysis, we gain insights into the healthcare data.
